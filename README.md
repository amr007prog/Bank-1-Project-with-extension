# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++)

## 📖 Overview
This is a **Bank Management System** built entirely in **C++**, designed to manage clients’ accounts through a simple **console-based interface**.  
The system allows users to perform essential banking operations like adding clients, depositing, withdrawing, deleting, and updating client data — all stored safely in a text file.
